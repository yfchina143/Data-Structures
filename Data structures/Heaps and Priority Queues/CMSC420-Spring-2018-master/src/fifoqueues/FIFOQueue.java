/**
 * <p><tt>FIFOQueue</tt> is an {@link Iterable} interface for FIFO queues. Such queues allow for enqueueing
 * an element in the back, dequeueing it from the front, as well as querying for the size of the queue,
 * the getFirst element, whether the queue is empty, and clearing the queue. <i>"Front"</i> and <i>"back"</i>
 * imply order of processing; not memory addressing! The exact position of an element in memory is dependent
 * on the various implementations of <tt>FIFOQueue</tt>, such as {@link LinearArrayFIFOQueue} and
 * {@link CircularArrayFIFOQueue}. </p>
 *
 *
 * <p>You should <b>not</b> edit this interface! It is given to you as a resource for your project.</p>
