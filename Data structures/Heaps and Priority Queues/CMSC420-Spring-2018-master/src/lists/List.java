/**
 * <p>A <tt>List</tt> is a linear ADT which offers insertion, search and deletion in at most linear time.
 * Elements can only be added to the front or the back, never in between.</p>
 * 
 * <p>It is a requirement that the type <i>T</i> is {@link Comparable}, or else we will not be able to
 * implement methods such as {@link #contains(Object)} and {@link #delete(int)}. The interface is {@link Iterable}
 * interface, which means that we can use for-each loops to easily access its elements.</p>
 *
 * <p>You should <b>not</b> edit this class! It is given to you as a resource for your project.</p>
